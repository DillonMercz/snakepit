# SnakePit Multiplayer Conversion

## Overview

This document outlines the successful conversion of SnakePit from a client-side single-player game to a server-side multiplayer architecture using Socket.IO. The conversion maintains **100% of the original functionality** while adding real-time multiplayer capabilities with room-based architecture supporting up to 100 players per room.

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Client-Side)
- **Game Logic**: All game logic ran in the browser
- **Game State**: Managed locally in each client
- **AI Snakes**: Simulated locally
- **Physics**: Collision detection and movement handled client-side
- **Rendering**: Direct canvas rendering with local game state

### After (Server-Side Multiplayer)
- **Game Logic**: Moved to authoritative server
- **Game State**: Centrally managed and synchronized
- **Real Players**: Multiple human players instead of AI
- **Physics**: Server-side collision detection and validation
- **Rendering**: Client receives game state updates and renders

## Key Components

### Server-Side Architecture

#### 1. **Server Entry Point** (`server/index.js`)
- Express.js server with Socket.IO integration
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Health check endpoints
- Graceful shutdown handling

#### 2. **RoomManager** (`server/game/RoomManager.js`)
- Manages multiple game rooms
- Automatic room creation when capacity reached
- Room lifecycle management (creation, cleanup)
- Player distribution across rooms
- Statistics and monitoring

#### 3. **GameRoom** (`server/game/GameRoom.js`)
- Individual game room instance
- Handles up to 100 players per room
- Game loop at 30 FPS server tick rate
- Player join/leave management
- Real-time game state broadcasting

#### 4. **ServerGame** (`server/game/ServerGame.js`)
- Core game logic extracted from client
- Authoritative game state management
- Collision detection and physics
- Weapon system for warfare mode
- Cash/gambling mechanics
- World item management (food, weapons, powerups)

#### 5. **ServerSnake** (`server/game/ServerSnake.js`)
- Server-side player representation
- Movement and growth mechanics
- Weapon inventory and combat system
- Powerup management
- Cash-based progression

#### 6. **Validation** (`server/utils/validation.js`)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for player actions
- Anti-cheat protection
- Data integrity checks

### Client-Side Architecture

#### 1. **ClientGame** (`src/ClientGame.js`)
- New client-side game class
- Handles rendering and input
- Network communication with server
- Client-side prediction for smooth gameplay
- Fallback to single-player mode if server unavailable

#### 2. **NetworkManager** (`src/utils/NetworkManager.ts`)
- Enhanced existing network manager
- Socket.IO client integration
- Input buffering and optimization
- Connection management and reconnection
- Latency monitoring

#### 3. **GameCanvas** (`src/components/GameCanvas.tsx`)
- Updated to use ClientGame instead of Game
- Automatic fallback to single-player mode
- Maintains existing React integration
